FIX:
    - Compile method from Keras models will probably reset weights.
    - Incorporate into the pipeline model/weights save/load.


Construct the pipeline to get the winner.
    - Need to select the last winner path
    so you have to save the best losses 
    with their corresponding paths.
    - You need to train for different tasks.
    - You need to visualize and evaluate results.
